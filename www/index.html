					Groove Basin is a music player server with a web-based user interface inspired by Amarok 1.4.
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Run it on a server connected to some speakers in your home or office. Guests can control the music player by connecting with a laptop, tablet, or smart phone. Further, you can stream your music library remotely.
			</p>
			<p>
				Groove Basin works with your personal music library; not an external music service. Groove Basin will never support DRM content.
			</p>

				Live discussion in #libgroove on Freenode.

			<h2>Features</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li>
					Fast, responsive UI. It feels like a desktop app, not a web app.
			  </li>
			  <li>
					Dynamic playlist mode which automatically queues random songs, favoring
				songs that have not been queued recently.
			  </li>
			  <li>
					Drag and drop upload. Drag and drop playlist editing. Rich keyboard
				shortcuts.
			  </li>
			  <li>
					Lazy multi-core
					<a href="http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness">EBU R128 loudness scanning</a>
					(tags compatible with
					<a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=ReplayGain_1.0_specification">ReplayGain</a>)
					and automatic switching between track and album mode.
					<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuEtQqC-Sqo">"Loudness Zen</a>
			  </li>
			  <li>
					Streaming support. You can listen to your music library - or share it
					with your friends - even when you are not physically near your home
					speakers.
			  </li>
			  <li>
					MPD protocol support. This means you already have a selection of
					<a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients">clients</a>
					which integrate with Groove Basin.
					For example
					<a href="https://github.com/abarisain/dmix">MPDroid</a>.
			  </li>
			  <li>
					<a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> scrobbling.
			  </li>
			  <li>
					File system monitoring. Add songs anywhere inside your music directory
					and
					they instantly appear in your library in real time.
			  </li>
			  <li>
					Supports GrooveBasin Protocol on the same port as MPD Protocol - use the
					`protocolupgrade` command to upgrade.
			  </li>

					A few months ago I published My Quest to Build the Ultimate Music Player, where I described some of the trials and tribulations that led to Groove Basin, an open-source music player server that I've been building off and on for almost 4 years...
